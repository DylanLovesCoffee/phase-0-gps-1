# Michael Glaser's GPS 1.1 reflections responses.

1. What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
None per se.  The session and the material was pretty straight forward.
2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
It provided me a better understanding of the version control and branching
workflow
3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guid?
I didn't ask too many questions and I had a pretty good understanding of the
material.  I did however ask him the difference between using the fetch and
pull commands.
4. What confuses you about Git?
Nothing particular comes to mind.  Git seems pretty straight forward at the
moment.
5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was pretty straight forward.  The pair and the guide were pretty good.
