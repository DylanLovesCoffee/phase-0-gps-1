1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
* I was struggling with the Git concepts of what exactly was occurring when a something was pushed and pulled via Git.
2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
* The concept of pushing and pulling repos was clarified during the GPS. I understood more about why I would need to push my branch into the repo and then create a pull request, so that a teammate could clone or pull the work that was done and work off it.
3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
* I asked about the Git workflow and for confirmation that I was following the right path. I also asked about tracking commit histories in the terminal to view a log of comments.
4. What still confuses you about Git?
* I still don't feel incredibly confident in pushing and pulling repos to and from GitHub, but I'm sure that will change as I get more used to doing so.
5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
* I really enjoyed having a guide quickly give tips and offer suggestions when needed. It served as a really efficient way to move our progress along. It was also great to have a third party buffer to weigh in on things.
